## Let's Make Coffee Using a Moka Pot

1. Preheat the water, by bringing the kettle to an almost boil.
2. Add the heated water to the botttom chamber, filling to the max line (or the bottom of the safety valve). 
3. Insert the filter basket into the bottom chamber. 
4. Fill the filter basket to the top with ground coffee. Level the surface off with your finger and brush away loose coffee from the edge of the filter basket. 
5. Screw the collecting chamber to the bottom chamber, using oven gloves. Donâ€™t over tighten. 
6. Put the moka pot on the hob, leaving the top lid open. Use moderate heat and make sure that the handle is not placed over the heat.
7. As the coffee fills the collecting chamber, observe its colour. Once it turns from brown to honey, use oven gloves to remove the pot from the hob and close the lid. 
8. Run cold water over the bottom chamber to stop extraction. This will help to give the coffee a the rich concentrated flavour. 
9. Pour the coffee into a cup. 
10. Add hot water or milk if desired, or sweeten to taste.
